    <h2>And here's a bit more about me:</h2>
    <p>My name is Jessica Oviedo and I am a sophomore at Staten Island Tech. I used to go to HSMSE in Manhattan. Last school year I would have to wake up at 5:30 just to get to school on time, so I'm glad I can wake up a bit later now. I have a dog and his name is Benji. He is a corgi and he is 2 years old. I go to taekwondo every Tuesday, Wednesday, and Friday. I've been doing martial arts since I was 5 and I have a black belt in karate and taekwondo.
